# Dog Friendly Trails <img align="right" width="75" height="75" src="assets/images/dogs-allowed-logo150x150.webp">

## Site Goals

Dog Friendly Trails is a site that looks to keep up to date with the most recent rules and regulations with regard to dogs on Irish walking trails.
The site will be targetted at people of all ages who like to hike Irish walking trails encouraging them to bring their dogs with them on hikes.      
<br>
Dog Friendly Trails will be useful for these hikers by allowing them to plan for hikes by picking out trails that are most suitable for dogs.
Hikers are invited to subscribe to get access to all the verified dog friendly trails. These verifications will be gathered by hikers submitting their experience with regard to dogs, on trails they have hiked.

# UX/UI & Features

## Design Choices

- A four page website was a preferred minimum to satisfy the user requirement as opposed to a one page scroll.
- A simple colour scheme is preferred with lots of white space to present a modern no nonsense site which is uncluttered clear and inviting.
- The hero section is shared between the home page and the subscribe page. The hero image enhances the message "Bring your dog" and is eye catching and attracts the users attention on the home page and also nudges the user to commit to subscribe on the subscribe page.
- The ethos section encourages the users to find out more about dog friendly trails and why they should bring their dogs with them on hikes.
- The trails page provides the user with interesting information on 3 popular hikes that are dog friendly. This also gives the user an idea of what is available to them if they subscribe.
- The gallery page provides an interesting array of pictures with dogs enjoying trails. It is anticipated that users will identify with these images and see themselves with their dogs hiking interesting trails.
- The subscribe page is hopefully where users browsing the site will arrive at. There are CTA's in the index page and the footer leading them in that direction. Once there the subscribe form is simnple and clear for them navigate and fill in. 

## Site Navigation

- The Logo and the site desccription are featured in the top left corner. They both link to the top of the index page called Home.
- The navigation links to pages are situated to the right at the top of the page. The other pages are Trails, Gallery and Subscribe.
- The navigation links are in an attractive and visually clear websafe font which change color on hover to show a contrast.
- The navigation link that is active is underlined.
- The font color of the navigation clearly stands out against a white background.
- The navigation clearly shows a person browsing the site which page they are viewing and makes the site easy to browse through and find areas of interest.
- The navigation links switch to hamburger style on smaller devices.
- The logo switches to the right when the hamburger is displayed.

## Header

- The branding of the site is consistent as this is the common header used throughout the site and is situated at the top of every page.
- The color scheme is simple with black text on white background for contrast and clarity while the logo is also simple with a black dog symbol inside a green circle.
- As the header includes the navigation links this also retains a consistent experience for the person browsing the site. 
- The header tells the user the name of the site which is Dog Friendly Trails. This is a very self explanatory site description and thus makes for a very clear information about the site and who it is intended for.
- The logo is also very helpful in providing emphasis on a positive dog image.

# Testing

Tests carried out by me.

- This site was tested by me to ensure that all of the pages on this site work in different browsers: Edge, Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
- I checked that the site works in responsive mode on all of these browsers.
- These tests were carried out on all pages of the site.
- The navigation works well on all browsers and the responsive hamburger works well on all browsers.
- The subscribe form works well and form validation works where required fields will not allow a bypass without valid entries. The email field will only accept a valid email structure and the submit button works as expected.

Validator Testing

- HTML:             All pages were passed through the official https://validator.w3.org/ and no errors were found.
- CSS:              All pages were passed through the official https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and no errors were found.
- Accessibility:    By running the site through https://web.dev/measure/ and I got all results in the green.

## Development Transition

### Initial Wireframe Concept

index.html                 |  trails.html
:-----------------:|:-----------------:
![](docs/wireframes/index.png)  |  ![](docs/wireframes/trailspage.png)

gallery.html               |  login.html
:-----------------:|:-----------------:
![](docs/wireframes/gallerypage.png)  |  ![](docs/wireframes/loginpage.png)

- July 12th I introduce a fancy multiline button with a pacman hover effect on Footer. See Credits for keenanpayne.com.
- July 14th I decide to remove the Login Form as I deem it confusing to include it at this point when I do not have a fully working login framework.
- So all login references become subscribe references.
- July 17th I am introduced to the world of flexbox. I decide to implement it on the site.
- This is an important development as it will have an impact on all my responsive development work yet to come.
- July 18th Use Javascript for Submit button and form validation. This is required because the button is not a regular submit button.
- July 21st I decide that Project1 should be free of Javascript and perform as CSS only
- So all javascript coding for the subscribe form are removed. 
- The Subscribe button which leans on javascript for its fancy multiline pacman styyle is now a regular submit button.
- This also applies to the Button in the footer.
- July 21st I decide to introduce a CSS only hamburger. I introduce this and it works fine. But this implementation fails the w3 html validator.
- I try a few others and same result. I naively decide to rollback to pre hamburger implementation attempts. 
- This does not go well but after some nervous work and assistance from Tutor support I get back to a good place.
- Lesson learned and an unexpected crash course in github.
- July 22nd I implement a CSS only hamburger. See Credits for alvarotrigo. This works well and does pass w3 html validator.
- July 24th I introduce CSS only lightbox. See Credits for veritygriscti

## Bug Fixes

July 12th I discovered a problem with the Readme file in that I could not get Wireframes in PDF format to work.
Fix 914854d So changed to images instead.

July 13th Due to a typo at the top of style.css which had a ripple effect of formatting issues further down the style.css document. I had various formatting problems that needed a tidy up.
Fix 00cfa73 Some css reformatting required.

July 14th Due to mistakes with relative path the site when viewed on github looked wrong with the hero image missing.
Fix 58ba9b4 Fixed relative path.

## Future Features
-ms flex for IE10 and ensure compatibility with older browsers
Login Form and Password Reset
Streamline HTML structure
Improve css to be more efficient
I would consider learning and using Flex grid for complete site layout
Improve use of flexbox
Setup a CMS like structure for Trails complete with Search and Filter options
A popup subscribe instead of a subscribe page
