# Dog Friendly Trails

Dog Friendly Trails is a site that looks to keep up to date with the most recent rules and regulations with regard to dogs on Irish walking trails.

The site will be targetted at people who like to hike Irish walking trails encouraging them to bring their dogs with them on hikes. 

Dog Friendly Trails will be useful for these hikers by allowing them to plan for hikes by picking out trails that are most suitable for dogs.

Hikers are invited to subscribe to get access to all the verified dog friendly trails.

These verifications will be gathered by hikers submitting their experience with regard to dogs on trails they have hiked.

Note to me: Add images of app on various screen sizes
