                <p>The quantity of dog friendly trails are getting reduced all of the time.<br><br>Summer 2022 saw
                    dogs
                    banned from Blue Flag beaches for example.</p>

                    <h2>Enjoy Good Company</h2>
                    <p>The saying "a dog is man's best friend" rings through for all dog owners. Taking your dogs on
                        hikes
                        enhances the bond you have with your dog. Dogs really love spending time with their
                        owners.The
                        added dimension of having your dog on a hike seems to energise and motivate when you hit the
                        steep
                        slope
                        that is testing your endurance. Better than any motivational fitness coach.</p>

                    <h2>Avoid Kennel Fees</h2>
                    <p>If you need to travel away to take on the hike, like for a weekend or something, then getting
                        your
                        dog
                        minded is problematic and often expensive. So much more convenient to bring your dog
                        along.
                        Dog
                        friendly accommodation usually charge a very nominal fee when booking your dog in as an
                        additional
                        guest.

                    <h2>Keep Your Dog Happy</h2>
                    <p>Leaving your dogs behind when you go for a hike is very stressful for your dog. Have you ever
                        seen a
                        dog
                        who likes being left behind. They always seem to know you are going for a walk or a
                        hike. Taking
                        your dog with you on hikes is great for them to experience new smells and surroundings. Of
                        course
                        they
                        are also great company and enhance any hike, their excitement is quite infectious.</p>

                    <h2>Keep Your Dog Healthy</h2>
                    <p>Keeping your dog in good physical shape keeps painful ailments away and even prolongs their
                        lifespan.
                        It
                        cuts down on visits to the Vet as well. Hikes are particularly good for exercising your
                        dog,
                        the
                        variety of terrain gives them a much better workout than a walk on the footpath or road.</p>
