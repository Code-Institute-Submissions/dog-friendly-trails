                    <p>The quantity of dog friendly trails are getting reduced all of the time.<br><br>Summer 2022 saw
                        dogs
                        banned from Blue Flag beaches for example.</p>

                        <h2>Enjoy Good Company</h2>
                        <p>The saying "a dog is man's best friend" rings through for all dog owners. Taking your dogs on
                            hikes
                            enhances the bond you have with your dog. Dogs really love spending time with their
                            owners.The
                            added dimension of having your dog on a hike seems to energise and motivate when you hit the
                            steep
                            slope
                            that is testing your endurance. Better than any motivational fitness coach.</p>

                        <p>If you need to travel away to take on the hike, like for a weekend or something, then getting
                            your
                            dog
                            minded is problematic and often expensive. So much more convenient to bring your dog
                            along.
                            Dog
                            friendly accommodation usually charge a very nominal fee when booking your dog in as an
                            additional
                            guest.

                        <p>Leaving your dogs behind when you go for a hike is very stressful for your dog. Have you ever
                            seen a
                            dog
                            who likes being left behind. They always seem to know you are going for a walk or a
                            hike. Taking
                            your dog with you on hikes is great for them to experience new smells and surroundings. Of
                            course
                            they
                            are also great company and enhance any hike, their excitement is quite infectious.</p>

                        <p>Keeping your dog in good physical shape keeps painful ailments away and even prolongs their
                            lifespan.
                            It
                            cuts down on visits to the Vet as well. Hikes are particularly good for exercising your
                            dog,
                            the
                            variety of terrain gives them a much better workout than a walk on the footpath or road.</p>
